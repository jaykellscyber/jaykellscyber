# **Hello, I'm Jay (Future SOC Team Leader)!**

## 👋 **About Me**

I am an aspiring Tier 1 SOC Analyst with a strong foundation in defensive cybersecurity and a background rooted in disciplined operational environments. I previously served as an Infantry Sniper in the British Army, where attention to detail, situational awareness, and calm decision-making under pressure were essential skills.

Since leaving the military, I have focused on building practical cybersecurity and networking skills, applying a structured, investigative mindset to digital threat detection and analysis.

I am self-taught, supported by the Cisco Networking Academy Junior Cybersecurity Analyst career path, and have developed hands-on experience through lab-based projects rather than relying solely on certifications.
This portfolio showcases practical SOC-relevant projects demonstrating my ability to deploy and operate security tooling, analyse logs and network traffic, triage alerts, and investigate suspicious activity in realistic environments.



## 🛠 **Core Skills**

- **SIEM Tools:** Wazuh, Splunk, Elastic Search. Security Onion
- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Collecting & analysing publicly available information from sources such as websites, social media, & online databases to support decision-making or investigations.
- **Log Analysis & Alert Triage:** Investigating suspicious activities in Windows/Linux environments
- **Incident Response:** Documenting and escalating security events following standard procedures
- **Threat Intelligence:** Basic analysis and correlation of indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- **Network Security:** Understanding of firewalls, IDS/IPS, and secure configurations  



## 🎓 **Certifications**

- **Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Career Pathway Certificate** – Cisco Networking Academy
- **Level 3 BTEC in Networking and Cybersecurity** – B2Work Group (Pending)
